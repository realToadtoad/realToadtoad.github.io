<h1>Portfolio</h1>

<p>
  Here are a few of my works, in the order of what I find the best / most
  important. I've done quite a lot during 2020, as the pandemic gave me the
  chance to complete a lot of projects in film and computer science. While I
  have works from prior, this year was the one where they really began to take
  shape.

        Created from inception to completion within a single week,
        &ldquo;Undoing&rdquo; is an attempt to create a short film with horror
        undertones. I don&rsquo;t typically watch/make horror, so it was
        exciting to try something outside of my comfort zone. A lot of work was
        put into this project (my group and I spent like four hours one day
        simply to figure out where we were going to film under COVID-19
        restrictions, and more than 10 hours were put into the editing of the
        film). I have to give so much thanks to my other teammates, Lance
        Sahagun and Anthony Wang, for the trust they gave me for this ambitious
        project.

        &ldquo;CTRL&rdquo; is a film that I find to be representative of the
        topics that I would eventually want to cover as a filmmaker in the
        future. The focus on the privacy threats in the Internet is a topic that
        I really care about, and therefore had a lot of fun making a video
        about. Most of the time on this project was dedicated to editing, which
        included the drawing of the various humanoid figures as well as figuring
        out how to use 3D modeling tools to animate different effects such as
        the person made out of particles.

        even done yet, the progress made on this project makes it one of the
        things I&rsquo;ve made that I&rsquo;m most proud of. We&rsquo;re going
        big for this project, including 360&deg; photos of our campus, videos of
        various staff members &ldquo;interacting&rdquo; with players, and over a
        dozen different puzzles throughout the course of the game.

        For an English project, a group of us were tasked with creating some sort
        of project based on the themes of Aldous Huxley's <i>Brave New World.</i> In
        the spirit of testing our limits, we picked the option to create a musical 
        composition. Two weeks later, we ended up with a satirically over-the-top,
        Broadway-esque number that mocks the superficiality of the World State, and
        the way they condition those living in it. Several nods to the book were 
        added and several aspects, such as the addition of vocaloids/digital signers,
        were used in order to highlight and poke fun at their values of conformity
        and the lack of individuality.

        Created for the Solar Boat competition, &ldquo;Wasting Water Is

        this video, I put a lot of effort into a professional-looking video in a
        &ldquo;video essay&rdquo; format, also learning how to use some features
        of Blender.

        A friend and I were commissioned by PTSA to make a video advertising
        their Winter Raffle Event. We bought a few RGB lights from Home Depot,
        set them up, and filmed in front of some black tablecloths. Due to the
        short length of the video, it was really quick to make it, the whole
        process only taking a couple of days. Yet, it was a lot of fun to do
        such a fact-paced, energetic video.

        Created for the EarthXHack hackathon, a group of us created an app
        inspired in design by the Today Weather app, except centered around
        tracking and prediction cases of COVID-19 in a location. This project
        was coded over the course of a weekend, and remains rather functional,
        although optimizations will be necessary if it was to be used for
        day-to-day use. Like most of my other recent programming projects, this
        was created with React Native, mostly due to the experience learning it
        I got through making PatriotApp (see below).

        Several months before I made this site, a friend told me about a
        JavaScript framework called Svelte. It seemed really cool, especially
        with its implications in terms of performance. So, when I wanted to
        refresh my website by making one nearly from scratch (unlike the
        previous one, where I just filled spaces in a template), I turned to
        Svelte. This site was created pretty much entirely within the course of
        a single day, which also involved learning Svelte without any prior
        experience with it.

        With extremely limited knowledge of JavaScript, React Native, and mobile
        app development, we were tasked with the semester project of creating an
        entire app of our choice. Our group decided to make an prototype of an
        app that could be used as a school information board (our mascot is the
        Patriot). I ended up researching for hours every day of how we were to
        build this app, sharing the finding with my group. In the end, we
        created an app that, while basic and not following good practices, was
        incredible considering our initial limitations.
